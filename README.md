Feel the Mayhem - When Deployments go Wrong

Bryden Oliver & Luke Parker

@brydenoliver @Hona

Come and join the fun as we deploy a broken website and much heartache and hilarity ensues. You'll learn about how not to react, some things it's good to monitor and just how to get things back on track.
We'll start at the basics and you'll get to see using real monitoring tools in realtime to solve issues. We'll cover a bit about how your teams culture contributes to your success and what to do after you've solved the problem.
We hope you'll leave having laughed and learned.
